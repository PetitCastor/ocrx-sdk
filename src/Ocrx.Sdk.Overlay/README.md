# Ocrx.Sdk.Overlay

Opt-in `IRecordSink` implementation that paints the latest observation in a topmost,
click-through Windows overlay. Register `new OverlaySinkFactory()` through
`PluginHostOptions.OverlayFactory`; on non-Windows systems the factory returns a no-op sink.

The overlay uses physical pixels and requests per-monitor-v2 DPI awareness when the package loads.
The plugin executable should also declare the setting in its `app.manifest`, because a manifest is
applied before any process window can be created:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<assembly manifestVersion="1.0" xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1">
  <application xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v3">
    <windowsSettings>
      <dpiAwareness xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/SMI/2016/WindowsSettings">
        PerMonitorV2
      </dpiAwareness>
    </windowsSettings>
  </application>
</assembly>
```

Reference that manifest from the plugin project:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <ApplicationManifest>app.manifest</ApplicationManifest>
</PropertyGroup>
```

The window never reads or modifies the game process, never requests elevation, and uses
`WS_EX_TRANSPARENT` plus `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE` so mouse and keyboard focus stay with the game.

## Styling

`OverlaySpec` supports installed fonts through `fontFamily`, or a plugin-packaged TrueType/OpenType
font through `fontFile`. A font file is loaded privately by the overlay process, so it does not need
to be installed on the player's system. `usePixelText` selects one-bit pixel rendering for bitmap-style
fonts. `borderColor`, `borderWidth`, and `cornerAccentLength` add an optional outline with diagonal
corner accents; leaving them unset preserves the original filled-pill appearance.
