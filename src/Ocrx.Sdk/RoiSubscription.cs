/// stay valid on any capture resolution. <paramref name="Scale"/> is the OCR upscale factor and is

/// converts implicitly — so declaring a region reads exactly as it did.</param>
/// <param name="Rect">The region, in reference space. The engine maps it to the captured frame;
/// never pre-scale it to a screen resolution.</param>
/// <param name="Scale">OCR upscale factor, per the remarks above: small UI text usually wants 2-4,
/// 0 takes the engine default, and the engine clamps whatever it cannot fit.</param>
/// <param name="Kind">What the engine should return for this region — OCR text, OCR with word
/// geometry, or raw pixels.</param>
