/// since that file was written — each one exactly once.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The three plugins each carried the same "write the embedded default if the file is missing"
/// block, and that block has a hole: it only ever runs on first run. A default added later — a new
/// <c>outputs</c> entry, say — never reaches anyone who has already run the plugin once, and
/// nothing says so. <see cref="SinkFactory"/> routes an unknown-to-the-user sink to a no-op without
/// a warning, so the feature is simply absent rather than broken, which is the hardest kind of
/// missing to notice.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Rewriting the file unconditionally would fix that and introduce a worse problem: a user who
/// deliberately deleted an output would get it back on every run, with no way to refuse it short of
/// editing the binary. So each entry in the embedded <c>outputs</c> array carries an
/// <c>addedIn</c> version, and a merge only ever considers entries newer than the version stamped
/// on the user's file (<see cref="PluginConfig.ConfigVersion"/>). Anything the user has already
/// been offered is never reconsidered, whatever they subsequently did with it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Gating on the entry rather than on the file as a whole is what makes the promise survive more
/// than one bump. Comparing the embedded defaults against what the user currently has would read
/// "deleted" and "never offered" as the same state, and re-add a declined default on the next
/// version after the one that introduced it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The merge is strictly additive — it never changes a value the user already has, and never
/// removes anything. A plugin that has not opted in (no <c>configVersion</c> in its embedded
/// default, i.e. version 0) keeps exactly today's first-run-only behaviour, and so does an
/// individual <c>outputs</c> entry with no <c>addedIn</c>.
