# OCRX.Sdk.Testing

The testing companion to `Ocrx.Sdk`, in the shape of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing`: a
public surface for driving a plugin under test, so a plugin in its own repository needs no
`InternalsVisibleTo` from the SDK.

Two layers. `TickDataBuilder` and `FakePluginServices` cover unit tests — no engine, no OCR, no
game. `ReplayHarness` covers parity: it spawns a real `Ocrx.Engine.exe` replaying a PNG corpus and
drives the plugin through its real `OcrxPluginHost` path, which is what a plugin's CI runs.

## Install

```powershell
dotnet add package Ocrx.Sdk.Testing
```

The first OCRX package train is version `2.0.0`.

## Unit test

```csharp
var plugin = new CounterPlugin();
var services = new FakePluginServices();
var tick = new TickDataBuilder().Text("counter", "4/8").Build();

await plugin.OnTickAsync(TickContext.ForTesting(tick, services), default);

Assert.Equal("4/8", Assert.Single(services.Emitted).RawText);
```

The builder produces a tick the way the engine would have sent it — through the SDK's own wire
mapping — so a tick that could never arrive on the wire cannot pass a test. It covers `.Text`,
`.Detailed`, `.Pixels`, `.Errored`, plus `.Manual()`, `.FrameSeq(n)`, and `.At(instant)`.

## Parity test

```csharp
var result = await ReplayHarness.RunAsync(new ReplayOptions
{
    EnginePath = EngineLocator.Resolve(),
    CorpusDir = ReplayCorpus.Resolve("Fixtures/Replay/my-corpus"),
    Plugin = new CounterPlugin(),
});

Assert.Equal(StreamEndReason.ReplayCompleted, result.Reason);
```

`EngineLocator.Resolve()` honours `OCRX_ENGINE_PATH` and otherwise uses the current per-user OCRX installation.
Corpus layout and capture: [`docs/REPLAY.md`](https://github.com/PetitCastor/ocrx-sdk/blob/master/docs/REPLAY.md).

### Parity test against a video

Set `VideoPath` instead of `CorpusDir` to drive the same run from an MP4 (`--video`, TASK-25) — one
file standing in for a long session that would be thousands of PNGs. Set exactly one of the two;
`RunAsync` throws if both or neither is set.

```csharp
var result = await ReplayHarness.RunAsync(new ReplayOptions
{
    EnginePath = EngineLocator.Resolve(),
    VideoPath = ReplayCorpus.Resolve("Fixtures/Replay/my-clip/session.mp4"),
    VideoFps = 2,   // optional; null leaves the engine on its own 1000/ScanIntervalMs default
    Plugin = new CounterPlugin(),
});

Assert.Equal(StreamEndReason.ReplayCompleted, result.Reason);
```

The harness only ever drives the deterministic drain — it never asks for `--video-realtime` or
`--video-loop`, which exist for interactive dev against a live engine, not an automated assertion.
